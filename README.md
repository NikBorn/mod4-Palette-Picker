Palette-Picker

INTRO

For this project I was tasked with individually building a full stack application that will create a random color palette.  Users should be able to create a project and each project can have multiple color palettes.  Users should also be able to lock one or more colors and still be able to have the unlocked colors change.  Lastly, users should be able to delete a previously saved palette.

TECH STACK

Backend: I built the backend of this project with Express, Knex, and PostgreSQL.  I used mocha, chai, and chai-http for server-side testing.

Frontend: I built the frontend using jQuery.  The assignment required us NOT to use React or another type of framework to keep the code as simple as possible, allowing us to focus more on the backend of the application.
